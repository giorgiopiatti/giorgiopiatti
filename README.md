## About Me:
I'm Swiss, 24 years old, highly driven and technically proficient machine learning engineer!

CS Master's student working as a Research Assistant, with a focus on large language model (LLM) evaluation and multi-agent
simulations. Co-authored 3 papers published at workshops and top-tier conferences, with experience managing the entire
research process—from experimental design to publication. Proficient in a wide array of technical tools and programming
languages essential for data science and machine learning.


## Present:
I’m working as Student Research Assistent with Zhijing Jin at ETH Zürich.

## Future:
I am looking for a full time position starting January 2025. 

If you're looking for someone that
- has broad machine learning expertise
- is able organize and manage large experiments
- loves to code from 0 to 100 an ML solution
then I might be your guy.

## Some projects I've worked on recently:

I worked on [Multilingual Trolley Problems for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02273) (Paper Under review)

During my Master Thesis I worked on [Cooperate or Collapse: Emergence of Sustainable Cooperation in a Society of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16698), which resulted in a paper under review. I've created a multi-agent simulation plattform for Large Language Model, [Governance of the Commons Simulation](https://github.com/giorgiopiatti/GovSim)  to test if LLMs achieve sustainable equilibrium and investigate multi-agent collaboration.


  
[SUBER: An RL Environment with Simulated Human Behavior for Recommender Systems](https://github.com/SUBER-Team/SUBER) (Paper accepted at ECAI 2024): A framework for synthetic environments that simulate human behavior by harnessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We complement our framework with in-depth ablation studies and demonstrate its effectiveness with experiments on movie and book recommendations. By utilizing LLMs as synthetic users, we introduce a modular and novel framework for training RL-based recommender systems. 

[Learning to Bluff and Cooperate: RL in Briscola](https://github.com/TiCinesi/Learning-to-Bluff-and-Cooperate) We construced a multi-agent Briscola (italian card game) environment and trained RNN-based agents using  reinforcement learning.
