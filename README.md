## About Me:
I'm Swiss, 24 years old, highly driven and technically proficient machine learning engineer!

Currently, I work as a student research assistant, and I expect to complete my master's degree in 2024.
My hands-on experience spans six ETH projects and three research projects, resulting in academic papers (one workshop, two under review). I am passionate about continuously learning new technologies and eager to contribute to cutting-edge research and development in a dynamic engineering environment.

## Present:
I’m working as Student Research Assistent with Zhijing Jin and Mrinmaya Sachan at ETH Zürich.

## Future:
I am looking for a full time position starting December 2024 or January 2025. 

If you're looking for someone that
- has broad machine learning expertise
- is able organize and manage large experiments
- loves to code from 0 to 100 an ML solution
then I might be your guy.

## Some projects I've worked on recently:

I worked on [Multilingual Trolley Problems for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02273) (Paper Under review)

During my Master Thesis I worked on [Cooperate or Collapse: Emergence of Sustainable Cooperation in a Society of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16698), which resulted in a paper under review. I've created a multi-agent simulation plattform for Large Language Model, [Governance of the Commons Simulation](https://github.com/giorgiopiatti/GovSim)  to test if LLMs achieve sustainable equilibrium and investigate multi-agent collaboration.


  
[SUBER: An RL Environment with Simulated Human Behavior for Recommender Systems](https://github.com/SUBER-Team/SUBER) A framework for synthetic environments that simulate human behavior by harnessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We complement our framework with in-depth ablation studies and demonstrate its effectiveness with experiments on movie and book recommendations. By utilizing LLMs as synthetic users, we introduce a modular and novel framework for training RL-based recommender systems. 

[Briscola RL](https://github.com/TiCinesi/Learning-to-Bluff-and-Cooperate) We construced a multi-agent Briscola (italian card game) environment and trained RNN-based agents using  reinforcement learning.
